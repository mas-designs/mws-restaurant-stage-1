[x] Stage 1

### How To Run

Simply `cd or ls` into the dist directory and startup your python server via `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` or `python -m http.server 8000` if you have python 3.x

Make sure that the backend-server is running, which is the mws-restaurant-stage-2 github repo from udacity
